## 📍 Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based project that analyzes user ratings and provides movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, it leverages libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to process data and predict user preferences.

---

## 👾 Features

- 📊 Real-time movie rating analysis
- 🧠 Collaborative filtering recommendation engine
- 📈 Cosine similarity to find similar movies
- 🎯 Personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences
- 📂 Notebook-based implementation for ease of exploration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ☑️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn notebook
```

---

### ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and open the notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aadi010105/Movie-Recommendation
cd Movie-Recommendation
jupyter notebook
```

---

### 🤖 Usage

1. Open `MoviesPrediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell in sequence to load data, train the model, and get recommendations.
3. Modify the input cell to enter a different movie name and get new recommendations.

## 📌 Project Roadmap

* ✅ Load and clean movie ratings dataset
* ✅ Build recommendation model using cosine similarity
* ⏳ Improve model performance with additional metadata (genres, actors, etc.)
* ⏳ Add GUI or web interface (Streamlit/Flask)
* ⏳ Export model for deployment
